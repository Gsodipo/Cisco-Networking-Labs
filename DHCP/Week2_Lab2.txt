1. I changed the IP settings on each workstation to automatic and verify their 
addresses once more. Both IPv4 and IPv6 is set to automatic. 

2. I used to the shop ip dhcp conflict command to see any type of conflict in the router and when i used the command it was empty
R2#sh ip dhcp conflict
IP address        Detection method   Detection time          VRF


3. I used the show ip dhcp pool command to see if there was a problem with the pool, the pool turned out to be fine.

R2#sh ip dhcp pool

Pool LAN4_10 :
 Utilization mark (high/low)    : 100 / 0
 Subnet size (first/next)       : 0 / 0 
 Total addresses                : 254
 Leased addresses               : 0
 Excluded addresses             : 1
 Pending event                  : none

 1 subnet is currently in the pool
 Current index        IP address range                    Leased/Excluded/Total
 10.10.10.1           10.10.10.1       - 10.10.10.254      0    / 1     / 254

4. I used the show run command on R2 to see the issue with the DHCP settings on the router. Everything seemed to be fine
hostname R2
!
!
!
enable secret 5 $1$mERr$WvpW0n5HghRrqnrwXCUUl.
!
!
ip dhcp excluded-address 10.10.10.1 10.10.10.100
!
ip dhcp pool LAN4_10
 network 10.10.10.0 255.255.255.0
 default-router 10.10.10.1
 dns-server 10.10.20.1
 domain-name ccnp4lab.com


5. I used the show ip dhcp binding command to display DHCP binding information for IP address assignment and subnet allocation. It was empty
R2#sh ip dhcp binding
IP address       Client-ID/              Lease expiration        Type
                 Hardware address

6. I went to router R1 and i was able to  see the issue with the DHCP settings on the router. On inspection in interface G0/0/1 there is no helper address interface whereas
in G0/0/0 we can see the ip address.
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/0
 ip address 10.10.20.1 255.255.255.0
 ip helper-address 10.10.20.254
 duplex auto
 speed auto
 ipv6 address FE80::1:1 link-local
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:A:B::1/64
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0/1
 ip address 10.10.10.1 255.255.255.0
 duplex auto
 speed auto
 ipv6 address FE80::1:2 link-local
 ipv6 address 2001:DB8:A:A::1/64
!

To solve this issue i went into G0/0/1 and configired the ip helper address using the same ip address as the one in G0/0/0
R1(config)#int g0/0/1
R1(config-if)#ip helper-address 10.10.20.254
R1(config-if)#
