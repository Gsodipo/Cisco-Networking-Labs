  - DHCP configuration & troubleshooting
  
  - Static & dynamic routing (EIGRP, OSPF, eBGP)
  
  - Extended & IPv6 ACLs
  
  - VLAN connectivity
  
  - Troubleshooting real-world scenarios
  
  - Packet Tracer simulations

Each folder represents a different category of networking tasks, with Packet Tracer (.pka) files and troubleshooting documentation.
